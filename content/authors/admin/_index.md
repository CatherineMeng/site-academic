Yuan Meng is an AI/ML Performance Software Engineer at AMD, working on optimizing DNN workloads performance and driving the architecture for next-generation AI Engines.
Prior to joining AMD, Yuan Meng obtained Ph.D. in Computer Engineering at the University of Southern California under the advisement of Professor [Viktor K. Prasanna](https://sites.usc.edu/prasanna/).
Her research interests are accelerating computationally intensive algorithms on heterogeneous computing platforms, and developing portable software and libraries for the same. The main focuses in her thesis are in accelerating Reinforcement Learning algorithms and Deep Learning Models on emerging infrastructures with shared memory, data parallel architecture (CPU, GPU), and spatial architecture (FPGA).
